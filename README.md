# Echo Server

Self-hosted communication server with extensible Lua scripting API for customisation. Designed to be scriptable and allow custom client implementations.

## WIP

Currently the project is on very early stage of development.  
Contributions are welcome!

### Todo list

Here's what my current goals are (from highest to lowest priority):

1. Voice chat
2. Auth users with save to DB
3. Comptime channels (rooms for [voice]chatting) definitions
4. Custom Lua scripts support
5. Screen sharing

## How to use it?

I am also working on _demo_ version of client which is also [open source](https://github.com/Makefolder/echo-demo-client).  
This client is completely usable, but still more like a demo.

I don't have plans to develop any clients for this server except the demo version which showcases how to work with this server.
